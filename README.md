# About this site.

We were presented with a task to reflect what we have learned about Python and Flaskk and enabling CRUD
I took the opportunity to create an restaurant database search engine where users can search for restauraunts based on the the
type of cuisine (e.g Italian, chinese, japanese, american etc..).
Users are also able create feedback and have it displayed under Feedback page and have the ability to delete and update restaurant
